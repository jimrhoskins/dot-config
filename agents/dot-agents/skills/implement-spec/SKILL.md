You have been provided a spec. This spec should have tickets associated with it, describing how to implement the spec.

The issue tracker should have been provided to you. If not, tell the user to run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`.

The goal is the entire spec implemented on a single **integration branch**, with every ticket resolved the way the issue tracker closes work.

The tickets are not a list of steps. They are a **task graph** with blocking relationships between them. This means there is always a **frontier** of tickets which are ready to be grabbed.

Communication to and from subagents should be sparse. Communicate primarily through **context pointers**: to the spec, tickets, research notes, and previous commits. Don't duplicate information already available via pointers.

**Implementer subagents** should be run in the background where possible for maximum concurrency.

## Steps

1. Read the spec and tickets to understand the task graph.

2. (optional) Use an **exploration subagent** to conduct any exploration required by the tickets - relevant codebase files or external documentation. Ensure the exploration subagent can save files - it should save its markdown notes in a directory outside the repo, accessible by all future subagents. This lets **implementer subagents** focus on implementation rather than exploration.

3. Create the integration branch. If the issue tracker closes work through PRs, or the user asks for one, push the first passing slice and open a draft PR after the first merge in step 5 (a branch with no commits ahead of main can't open one). Record its actual URL and link the spec and tickets. If publication is blocked, report the local commit and the exact blocker; a planned PR is not a delivered PR.

4. Use **implementer subagents** to implement each ticket, each in its own worktree on its own branch. Each implementer subagent:
   - confirms its worktree is based on the integration branch before starting, and resets onto it if not;
   - calls the Skill tool with `tdd` to build the ticket;
   - merges the integration branch tip into its own branch before reporting done

5. Once an **implementer subagent** completes, merge its work to the integration branch with a **merger subagent**.

6. If this changes the **frontier** of available tickets, kick off more **implementer subagents** to work on the new tickets. This allows for maximum concurrency.

7. Once all tickets are complete, call the Skill tool with `code-review` on the integration branch. Fix all issues raised by the code review in a single **implementer subagent**.

8. Verify delivery before reporting completion:
   - **PR delivery:** after validation and review pass, push the final integration head, verify the PR points to that commit, then mark it ready. Report the actual URL, commit, checks run and unresolved checks or runtime work.
   - **Local delivery:** when no PR is required, report the local branch, commit and checks instead.
   - **Blocked publication:** report local-only work, its commit and the exact blocker, not a ready PR.

   Distinguish code delivery from merge, deployment and runtime acceptance; resolve tickets only when their actual completion criteria are met. Progress updates name completed artifacts and remaining blockers, not promises of imminent delivery.

9. Clean up all **implementer subagent** worktrees.
